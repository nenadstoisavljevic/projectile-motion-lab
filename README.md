# Projectile Motion Lab

A report written for SPH3U0

This lab report demonstrates how a projectile that is undergoing a horizontal launch will travel at a constant velocity. Various kinematic equations were used to show this alongside collected data to put it all into perspective.

It is common knowledge that projectiles travel at a constant velocity in the horizontal direction, nevertheless, this report examines the relations between the mathematical equations and observed evidence after carrying out the experiment. The vertical component of the launch undergoes uniformly accelerated motion, which again is shown through the use of kinematic equations.
