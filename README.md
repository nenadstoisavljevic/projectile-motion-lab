# Projectile Motion Lab

A report written for SPH3U0

This lab report demonstrates how a projectile that is undergoing a horizontal launch will travel at a constant velocity in the horizontal direction. This is because no other force is acting upon the projectile (in the horizontal direction) except for the initial force that was exerted on the projectile, to put it into motion. Various kinematic equations were used to show this, alongside a 2D vector diagram to put it all into perspective. In the end, the final velocity of the projectile was calculated by putting together the horizontal and vertical components of the projectile launch.

It is common knowledge that projectiles travel at a constant velocity in the horizontal direction (without an external force acting on it), nevertheless, this report examines the relations between the mathematical equations and observed evidence after carrying out the experiment. The vertical component of the launch experiences uniformly accelerated motion due to the force of gravity, which again is shown through the use of kinematic equations.
